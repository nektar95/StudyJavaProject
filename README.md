  When we start application we've got grey blank space with green rectangle, it's our restaurant. Restaurant adress is always random.
We can add some providers and customers, they're another colorful rectangles. As we will see there is button for new order for random provider
and button for new meals, which opens dialog box with editbox to fill with info about our new tasty and expensive meal.
  Clicking on rectangles opens new windows with informations about them and also changes their colors.
